| 112 Ukraine was deprecated following a 2019 RfC, which showed overwhelming consensus for the deprecation of a slew of sources associated with Russian disinformation in Ukraine. It was pointed out later in a 2020 RfC that 112 Ukraine had not been explicitly discussed in that first discussion prior to its blacklisting request. Further discussion established a rough consensus that the source is generally unreliable, but did not form a consensus for deprecation or blacklisting. The prior blacklisting was reversed as out of process.

There is general consensus that reliability varies among the website's articles and should be determined on a case-by-case basis; while the high-confidence ratings are generally reliable as they are reviewed carefully by experts, others depend on blind user surveys that some editors consider opinionated and less reliable.

| Due to persistent abuse, Global Research is on the [[WP:SPB|Wikipedia spam blacklist]], and links must be [[Wikipedia talk:WHITELIST|whitelisted]] before they can be used. The Centre for Research on Globalisation is the organization that operates the Global Research website (globalresearch.ca, not to be confused with {{pslink|GlobalSecurity.org}}). The CRG is considered generally unreliable due to its propagation of [[conspiracy theories]] and lack of editorial oversight. It is [[WP:BIASED|biased or opinionated]], and its content is likely to constitute [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]]. As it often covers [[WP:FRINGE|fringe]] material, [[WP:PARITY|parity of sources]] should be considered.

| ''[[China Daily]]'' is a publication owned by the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. The 2021 RfC found narrow consensus against deprecating ''China Daily'', owing to the lack of available usable sources for Chinese topics. There is consensus that ''China Daily'' may be used, cautiously and with good editorial judgment, as a source for the position of the Chinese authorities and the Chinese Communist Party; as a source for the position of ''China Daily'' itself; as a source for facts about non-political events in mainland China, while noting that (a) ''China Daily''{{'}}s interpretation of those facts is likely to contain political spin, and (b) ''China Daily's'' omission of details from a story should not be used to determine that such details are untruthful; and, with great caution, as a supplementary (but not sole) source for facts about political events of mainland China. Editors agree that when using this source, [[WP:RSCONTEXT|context matters]] a great deal and the facts should be separated from ''China Daily''{{'}}s view about those facts. It is best practice to use [[WP:INTEXT|in-text attribution]] and [[WP:IC|inline citations]] when sourcing content to ''China Daily''.

| The ''Daily Mail'' was deprecated in the 2017 RfC, and the decision was reaffirmed in the 2019 RfC. There is consensus that the ''Daily Mail'' (including its online version, ''[[MailOnline]]'') is generally unreliable, and its use as a reference is generally prohibited, especially when other sources exist that are more reliable. As a result, the ''Daily Mail'' should not be used for determining notability, nor should it be used as a source in articles. The ''Daily Mail'' has a "reputation for poor fact checking, sensationalism, and flat-out fabrication". The ''Daily Mail'' may be used in rare cases in an [[WP:ABOUTSELF|about-self fashion]]. Some editors regard the ''Daily Mail'' as reliable historically, so old articles may be used in a historical context. (Note that dailymail.co.uk is not trustworthy as a source of past content that was printed in the ''Daily Mail''.) The restriction is often incorrectly interpreted as a "ban" on the ''Daily Mail''. The deprecation includes other editions of the UK ''Daily Mail'', such as the Irish and Scottish editions. The UK ''Daily Mail'' is not to be confused with [[Daily Mail (disambiguation)|other publications named ''Daily Mail'']] that are unaffiliated with the UK paper.<!-- Disambiguation on purpose --> The dailymail.com domain was previously used by the unaffiliated ''[[Charleston Daily Mail]]'', and reference links to that publication are still present.

| The ''Daily NK'' is an [[online newspaper]] based in [[South Korea]] that reports on stories based inside of [[North Korea]]. There is no consensus as to if it should be deprecated or used with attribution. There is a consensus that this source, as well as all other sources reporting on North Korea, is generally unreliable. However, due to a paucity of readily accessible information on North Korea, as well as a perception that ''Daily NK'' is not more unreliable than other sources on the topic, it can be used as a source, albeit with great caution.

Although citing Wikia as a source is against policy, copying Fandom content into Wikipedia is permissible if it is published under a compatible license (some wikis may use licenses like CC BY-NC and CC BY-NC-ND, which are incompatible).

| Google Maps and Google Street View may be useful for some purposes, including finding and verifying geographic coordinates and other basic information like street names. However, especially for objects like boundaries (of neighborhoods, allotments, etc.), where other reliable sources are available they should be preferred over Google Maps and Google Street View. It can also be difficult or impossible to determine the veracity of past citations, since Google Maps data is not publicly archived, and may be removed or replaced as soon as it is not current. Inferring information solely from Street View pictures may be considered [[Wikipedia:No original research|original research]]. Note that due to [[restrictions on geographic data in China]], [[OpenStreetMap]] coordinates for places in [[mainland China]] are almost always much more accurate than Google's – despite OpenStreetMap being user-generated – due to the severe distortion introduced by most commercial map providers. (References, in any case, are usually not required for geographic coordinates.)

[[WP:Citing IMDb]] describes two exceptions, both of which do not require [[WP:CS|citations]] because the film itself is implied to be the primary source. Although certain content on the site is reviewed by staff, editors criticize the quality of IMDb's fact-checking. A number of editors have pointed out that IMDb content has been copied from other sites, including Wikipedia, and that there have been a number of notable hoaxes in the past.

There is currently rough consensus that Fantano is considered to be an established subject-matter expert as it pertains to music reviews and that these reviews may be used in an article as ''attributed opinion''. However, per Wikipedia policy regarding self-published sources, these reviews should never be used as third-party sources about living people. There is also currently a rough consensus that Fantano's reviews do not always constitute [[WP:DUE|due weight]] and that discretion should be applied on a case-by-case basis when determining if a review from ''The Needle Drop'' is appropriate to include in a given article.

Some editors have said that low-quality reporting also appeared in some preceding years, but a specific date after which the articles are considered generally unreliable has not been proposed. Previous consensus was that ''Rolling Stone'' was generally reliable for political and societal topics before 2011. Most editors say that ''Rolling Stone'' is a [[WP:PARTISAN|partisan source]] in the field of politics, and that their statements in this field should be [[WP:INTEXT|attributed]].

| The Southern Poverty Law Center is considered generally reliable on topics related to [[hate group]]s and [[extremism]] in the United States. As an advocacy group, the SPLC is a [[WP:BIASED|biased and opinionated source]]. The organization's views, especially when labeling hate groups, should be [[WP:INTEXT|attributed]] per [[WP:RSOPINION]]. Take care to ensure that content from the SPLC constitutes [[WP:DUE|due weight]] in the article and conforms to the [[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]] policy. Some editors have questioned the reliability of the SPLC on non-United States topics.

As a [[WP:SPS|self-published source]], it is considered generally unreliable and should be avoided unless the author is a [[WP:EXPERTSOURCE|subject-matter expert]] or the tweet is used for an [[WP:ABOUTSELF|uncontroversial self-description]]. In most cases, Twitter accounts should only be cited if they are [[Account verification|verified accounts]] or if the user's identity is confirmed in some way. Tweets that are not covered by reliable sources are likely to constitute [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]]. Twitter should never be used for third-party claims related to [[WP:BLPSPS|living persons]].

| Uniquely among WMF sites, Wikidata's statements can be directly transcluded into articles; this is usually done to provide external links or infobox data. For example, more than two million external links from Wikidata are shown through the {{tl|Authority control}} template. There has been controversy over the use of Wikidata in the English Wikipedia due to its infancy, its vandalism issues and its sourcing. While there is no consensus on whether information from Wikidata should be used at all, there is general agreement that any Wikidata statements transcluded need to be just as – or more – reliable compared to Wikipedia content. As such, [[Module:WikidataIB]] and some related modules and templates filter unsourced Wikidata statements by default; however, other modules and templates, such as [[Module:Wikidata]], do not.

| Most editors believe that Wikinews articles do not meet Wikipedia's [[WP:V|verifiability standards]]. As Wikinews does not enforce a strong editorial policy, many editors consider the site equivalent to a [[WP:SPS|self-published source]], which is generally unreliable.

| WordPress.com is a [[WP:BLOGS|blog]] hosting service that runs on the [[WordPress]] software. As a [[WP:SPS|self-published source]], it is considered generally unreliable and should be avoided unless the author is a [[WP:EXPERTSOURCE|subject-matter expert]] or the blog is used for [[WP:ABOUTSELF|uncontroversial self-descriptions]]. WordPress.com should never be used for claims related to [[WP:BLPSPS|living persons]]; this includes interviews, as even those cannot be authenticated.

| ''WorldNetDaily'' was deprecated in the 2018 RfC. There is clear consensus that ''WorldNetDaily'' is not a reliable source, and that it should not be used because of its particularly poor reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. The website is known for promoting falsehoods and [[conspiracy theories]]. Most editors consider ''WorldNetDaily'' a [[WP:PARTISAN|partisan source]]. ''WorldNetDaily''<nowiki />'s [[WP:SYNDICATED|syndicated content]] should be evaluated by the reliability of its original publisher, and the citation should preferably point to the original publisher.

| The World Socialist Web Site is the online news and information publication of the [[International Committee of the Fourth International]], a [[Trotskyist]] political organisation. Most editors consider it to be reliable for the [[WP:INTEXT|attributed]] [[WP:RSOPINION|opinions]] of its authors. There is no consensus on whether it is reliable for factual reporting. If used, it must be evaluated for [[WP:UNDUE|due weight]] as it is an [[WP:BIASED|opinionated source]]. Some editors suggest that it may be more reliable for news related to labor issues.

| ''XBIZ'' is considered generally reliable for the adult industry.

| Xinhua News Agency is the official state-run press agency of the People's Republic of China. There is consensus that Xinhua is generally reliable for factual reporting except in areas where the government of China may have a reason to use it for propaganda or disinformation. Xinhua is also generally reliable for the views and positions of the Chinese government and its officials. For subjects where the Chinese government may be a stakeholder, the consensus is almost unanimous that Xinhua cannot be trusted to cover them accurately and dispassionately; some editors favour outright deprecation because of its lack of [[WP:IS|editorial independence]]. There is no consensus for applying any one single label to the whole of the agency. Caution should be exercised in using this source, extremely so in case of [[WP:REDFLAG|extraordinary claims]] on controversial subjects or [[WP:BLP|biographies of living people]]. When in doubt, try to find better sources instead; use [[WP:INTEXT|inline attribution]] if you must use Xinhua.

Take care with syndicated content, which varies from highly reliable sources to very unreliable sources. Syndicated content should be evaluated as you would evaluate the original source.
